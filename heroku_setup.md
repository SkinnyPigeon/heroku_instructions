# Heroku Setup

### Heroku

Heroku is a free hosting site similar to AWS, Azure, etc... I like it as it's super easy to deploy to and test out things in the real world. Best of all though is it's completely **FREE** ðŸ‘»  

First things first we're going to need you to get setup on the heroku side of things:  
* Go to [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/â€Ž) and sign up
* Next navigate to find the [Heroku CLI tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
  - If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed then I'd suggest using that for the easiest way. Just run the following from your terminal:

`$ brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku`
